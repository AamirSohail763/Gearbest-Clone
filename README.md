# Gearbest-Clone

## About the Project
We made this as the project of our Masai course Unit-2 Construct Week. This is a clone of the website gearbest.com and we have tried to make it look as similar as we could while keeping the functionality of the original website in mind. Gearbest.com is an e-commerce website which deals in electronic products. This repo consists of multiple files which serves the same function as the original website while some parts of it are static as well, but at the same time we have also tried to maintain the asthetic and functionality of the parent website as much as we can. We look forward to improve this further and add more functionlity to it.
